### Hi, I'm Caleb Sawyer. 

  My favorite things are to cry and pretend I'm sad, cook delicious food, mix cocktails, drink them, and start this cycle over again.

  I can be very professional, but I prefer to be dumb and happy instead, with complete disregard of myself. 
  I laugh loudly, I make terrible jokes, and those two facts themselves are an awful pairing that only begins to dip into the mess that is me.

I'm doing **my best** to pretend that r markdown and knittr for github pages isn't just "MySpace" for nerds. But my best isn't enough. I'm gonna try and find a way to play music when you navigate to this page. Like the good ol' days. RIP MySpace 2008.


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../media/me.jpg")
