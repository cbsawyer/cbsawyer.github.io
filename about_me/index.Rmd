### Hi, my name is Caleb Sawyer, and I live in Provo, Utah. 

My favorite things are to cry and pretend I'm sad

See, I can make **bold test** cause I'm a big kid now.

 I can be very professional, but I more prefer to be dumb, and happy instead, with complete disregard of myself. 
 I laugh loudly, I make terrible jokes, and those two facts themselves are an awful pairing that only begins to dip into the mess that I am.

I'm doing the best to pretend that r markdown and knittr isn't just smart-peoples' "MySpace". But my best isn't enough. I'm gonna try and find a way to play music when you navigate to this page. If there is one.


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../media/me.jpg")
```
