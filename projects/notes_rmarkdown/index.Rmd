```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Now MY notes begin.



```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
library(plotly)

mpg %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_classic(lightable_options = 'hover') %>% 
  scroll_box(width="500px", height= "200px")

p <- mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=displ,y=cty)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()

ggplotly(p)
```

The mean cty miles per gallon is `r round(mean(mpg$cty),2)` in this data set
